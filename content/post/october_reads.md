Hey  y’all! A quick summary of what I’ve read this month. Busy times, with little reading, but there were some good papers!

**Fast diversification through a mosaic of evolutionary histories characterizes the endemic flora of ancient Neotropical mountains**

*Vasconcelos, T.N., Alcantara, S., Andrino, C.O., Forest, F., Reginato, M., Simon, M.F., Pirani, J.R.*

I’ve read it when it first came out, since it comes from the same research group I was in before but revisited it for a journal club this month. The origins and diversification of montane vegetation is a long-standing question in biogeography, with many possible answers. The Brazilian campos rupestres sit on ancient geographic formations, and its super rich flora has been explained as the result of species accumulation over a long period of time, with little extinction. The authors here analyze several phylogenies of different flowering plant groups and see an increase in diversification in the last 5 my, probably indicating a complex assembly process of this diverse flora. 

**The phylogenetic diversity and structure of the seasonally dry forests in the Neotropics**

*Axel Arango, Fabricio Villalobos, David A. Prieto‐Torres, Roger Guevara*

doi: 10.1111/jbi.13991

The seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) are one exception to the general rule that plant richness increases towards the equatorial zone. In this paper, the authors use an extensive floristic database to test if the Pleistocene climatic instability could be the reason for this pattern, using measures of phylogenetic diversity and species richness. The main conclusion is that it’s not possible to attribute this pattern solely to the Pleistocene climate patterns. Nice paper, but oh boy, so many acronyms!

**Principles for creating a single authoritative list of the world’s species**

*Garnett, S.T. et al.*

doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000736

Short and sweet paper a list of recommendations on how to elaborate extensive lists of species. My favorite points are: (i) the species list must be based on science and free from nontaxonomic considerations and interference; (viii) contributors need appropriate recognition; (ix) list content should be traceable; (x) a global listing process needs both to encompass global diversity and to accommodate local knowledge of that diversity. I hope this catches on!

Besides that, a couple of books:

**Are prisons obsolete?**

*Angela Davis*

https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/213837/are-prisons-obsolete-by-angela-y-davis/

Angela Davis writing is brilliant, each chapter in this book could almost be a book itself. This is a good primer to understand how the prison system originated and evolved and what moves the abolitionist movement. I’ve read this title as part of a reading group I’m participating in, and now I’ll definitely read more of her work. 

**Braiding sweetgrass**

*Robin Wall Kimmerer*

I’ve started it a few days ago and it is such a delight to read. The pages go flying by, and reading it makes me feel as if I’m sitting by the fire on a cool night listening to someone very wise tell stories. I’ll post a more complete review once I finish it, but you should go grab a copy!
